# Hey! I'm Arthur. 😊

Thanks for checking out my profile!

Straight out of high school, I rekindled my love for tech thanks to a few jobs in that field, which eventually lead to me diving into the world of coding, and I've loved every minute of it since.<br>
Naturally, creating good software requires a lot of auxiliary skills, which is how I got into graphic design (UI/UX mostly) as well. I've found passion in that aspect of software development too, as it only improves the final product when done thoroughly.
